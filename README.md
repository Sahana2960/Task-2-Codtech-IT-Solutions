OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Creating a Portfolio Website

Objective
The goal of this task was to create a professional and personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a convenient and free platform for displaying my work.

Tools and Technologies
HTML: For structuring the web pages

CSS: For styling and designing the layout

For adding interactivity:
JAVASCRIPT
JQUERY
REACTJS
NODEJS

Git: For version control

GitHub Pages: For hosting the website

Steps Taken
Planning and Design

Conceptualization: Outlined the purpose and goals of the portfolio. Determined key sections to include, such as About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

Wireframing: Created wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of the website using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

Development

HTML: Developed the basic structure of the website using semantic HTML tags.

CSS: Styled the website to align with my personal brand. Used CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout, and implemented responsive design principles to ensure the site looks great on all devices.

JavaScript: Added interactivity, such as a project carousel, smooth scrolling, and form validation for the contact form.

Version Control

Git: Initialized a Git repository and made frequent commits to track changes. Used meaningful commit messages to document the development process.

Deployment

GitHub: Created a new repository on GitHub and pushed the local project to the remote repository.

GitHub Pages: Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings to host the website. Chose the branch to deploy (typically main or gh-pages).

Testing and Feedback

Cross-Browser Testing: Tested the website on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure compatibility.

Feedback: Shared the website with peers and mentors to gather feedback. Made improvements based on their suggestions.

Challenges and Solutions
Responsive Design: Ensured the website was fully responsive and looked good on various screen sizes by using media queries and flexible layouts.

GitHub Pages Deployment: Faced issues with custom domain setup but resolved them by carefully following GitHubâ€™s documentation and troubleshooting guides.

Outcome
The final portfolio website is a visually appealing and functional showcase of my work. It includes a professional introduction, detailed project descriptions, and an easy-to-use contact form. Hosting the site on GitHub Pages also provided me with a great learning experience in version control and deployment.
